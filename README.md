## Overview

Welcome to the Cart Application! This project is designed to demonstarte the cart of an ecommerce store. 

## Backend Information

Our backend is hosted on Render.com using the free plan. As a result, the backend service may experience downtime or take longer to respond if it has been inactive for a period of time. Specifically, there is a delay of up to 50 seconds when the service is inactive, as it needs to be spun up from a cold start.

## What to Expect

- **Initial Load Time:** If the backend has been inactive, it might take up to 50 seconds to become responsive.
- **Downtime:** Due to the limitations of the free plan, there may be intermittent downtime.

## How to Use

## Test user
   email : test@mail.com
   password : test1234

Please be patient if you encounter delays when accessing the backend. If the service is not loading or is taking too long, try again after a few minutes.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
